# Mobile Price Prediction

### Context
The mobile shop company has decided to introduce a new feature to help customers determine the price category of a mobile phone based on its specifications. This feature will allow customers to input the specific features they are looking for in a mobile phone, such as RAM, internal memory, camera quality, and screen size, and receive an estimated price range for the phone.

To develop this feature, the mobile shop company plans to build a predictive model that can estimate the price range of a mobile phone based on its features. The company has collected sales data from various companies in the mobile phone industry to train the predictive model.

Once the predictive model is developed, the mobile shop company plans to integrate it into their website and mobile app, allowing customers to use the feature to get an estimated price range for the mobile phone they are looking for. The company hopes that this feature will help customers make more informed purchasing decisions and enable them to find mobile phones that fit their budget and meet their specific needs.
